# PostgreSQL Schemas

An opensource repository of PostgreSQL schemas to get your projects started. 

Complete, tested schemas that anyone can contribute to with new migration files. 


## Getting started

You can freely access these databases online:

#### World

Cities, countries, and the language they speak


## Hosting locally

Every folder is a template / schema

## Keeping your database updated

You can run a diff tool (like [migra](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra)) against your current database to generate a migration script.
